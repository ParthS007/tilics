## What is good code?

Code is more than just instructions for machines; it’s a shared language for humans. Good code allows collaboration by ensuring that every person who interacts with it—the original author, a colleague, or even someone years later—can understand and contribute effectively.

Good code is clear, well-documented and embraces consistency.

Good code is not just a technical artefact; it’s a conversation. It bridges gaps, aligns efforts, and empowers teams to build software efficiently and joyfully.
