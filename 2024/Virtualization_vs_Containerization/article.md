# Virtualization vs Containerization

Virtual Machines and Containers are a way of creating self-contained virtual packages of software. However, they have different operations and characteristics.

Imagine we have a physical computer. Virtualization allows this single physical computer to act like multiple virtual computers running side by side, and we can allocate a portion of available resources (CPU, memory, network and storage) separately to each virtual computer.

Similar to the transformation shipping containers did in logistics, containers do the same for software development. Technically, containers are self-contained software packages containing all dependencies required to execute the included software.

Virtualization allows running multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical computer, while containerization allows deploying multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or computer, reducing resource overhead and efficiently scaling applications.

The comparison between containerization and virtualization is more about which technology suits a particular use case. By understanding both technologies, we can leverage them to meet our needs.
