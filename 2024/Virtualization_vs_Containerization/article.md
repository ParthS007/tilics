# Virtualization vs Containerization

The challenge for modern computers is to use hardware resources efficiently. This problem is addressed by virtualization and containerization, which offer strategies for effectively utilizing the hardware resources of a real computer.

## Key Differences:

1. Hardware Usage
    - Virtualization builds operating system-based virtual machines (VMs) on top of actual hardware.
    - Containerization makes physical hardware more efficient and lightweight by generating containers that run the same operating system (OS).

2. Resource Overhead
    - Since each virtual machine needs its operating system, virtual machines use more resources.
    - Since containers use the same operating system, they are lightweight and improve resource usage and startup times.

3. Isolation Level
    - Virtual Machines provide complete isolation, as each VM runs independently.
    - Containers share the operating system but provide process-level isolation.

The visualization shows the architectural differences and resource usage patterns between the two approaches, making it easier to understand their distinct characteristics.
